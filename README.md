# <sockios.h>

- This module is indended for use with NodeOS
- NodeOS does not currently contain any way to compile binary modules
- Until that time, this module will be pre-compiled for the version of Node shipped with NodeOS

If you are not running on NodeOS, I do *not* recommend using this module.

Once there is a npm-native method for handling platform binaries, we will switch to that.
